# Chinook SQL Project  

## Project Overview  
This project involved working with the Chinook database to practice SQL skills, extract meaningful insights, and present findings in a creative and visual format. The steps completed during the project are outlined below.  

## Steps Completed  

1. **Database Setup**  
   - The Chinook database was installed and configured using either DB Browser or the provided SQL workspace.  

2. **SQL Questions**  
   - A series of SQL queries were completed to review and master the concepts learned throughout the lessons.  
   - These queries were self-assessed to ensure a solid understanding of SQL.  

3. **Data Exploration and Visualization**  
   - Custom SQL queries were written to answer unique questions about the data.  
   - The resulting data was visualized using bar charts, histograms, or other plot types.  

4. **Presentation Creation**  
   - Insights and visualizations were compiled into a slide deck using presentation software such as PowerPoint, Google Slides, or similar tools.  
   - The presentation showcased the findings and demonstrated the ability to extract and communicate data-driven insights.  

5. **Problem-Solving with Knowledge Base**  
   - The knowledge base was utilized to address common questions and find solutions for any challenges encountered during the project.  

## Deliverables  
- **SQL Queries**: A collection of custom SQL queries developed for the project.  
- **Visualizations**: Data visualizations created from the results of the SQL queries.  
- **Presentation**: A slide deck presenting the findings, complete with visuals and explanations.  

## Tools and Technologies  
- **Database**: Chinook SQL database  
- **SQL Editor**: DB Browser or the provided SQL workspace  
- **Visualization Tools**: Bar charts, histograms, or other plots created using tools like Excel, Tableau, or Python visualization libraries.  
- **Presentation Software**: PowerPoint, Google Slides, or equivalent  

## How to Use This Repository  
1. Review the SQL queries to understand the logic behind the data extraction.  
2. Explore the visualizations to see how insights were presented.  
3. Refer to the presentation file to understand how the findings were communicated effectively.
