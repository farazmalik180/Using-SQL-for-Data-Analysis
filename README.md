# Using-SQL-for-Data-Analysis

Project Overview
This project involved working with the Chinook database to practice SQL skills, extract meaningful insights, and present findings in a creative and visual format. The steps completed during the project are outlined below.

Steps Completed
Database Setup

The Chinook database was installed and configured using either DB Browser or the provided SQL workspace.
SQL Questions

A series of SQL queries were completed to review and master the concepts learned throughout the lessons.
These queries were self-assessed to ensure a solid understanding of SQL.
Data Exploration and Visualization

Custom SQL queries were written to answer unique questions about the data.
The resulting data was visualized using bar charts, histograms, or other plot types.
Presentation Creation

Insights and visualizations were compiled into a slide deck using presentation software such as PowerPoint, Google Slides, or similar tools.
The presentation showcased the findings and demonstrated the ability to extract and communicate data-driven insights.
Problem-Solving with Knowledge Base

The knowledge base was utilized to address common questions and find solutions for any challenges encountered during the project.
Deliverables
